# Spatial-data-manipulation
As part of the spatial statistics course, the objective of this practical work is the manipulation of spatial data (vector and raster).
To do this, acled data on events in ECOWAS countries was used.
First, we count the events by country (subdivision 0), regions (subdivision 1) and departments (subdivision 2).
Secondly, an ECOWAS raster with a resolution of 10km is created where the value of the pixel is the number of events counted in it. another raster is then created to categorize the values ​​of the previous raster according to well-defined thresholds.
